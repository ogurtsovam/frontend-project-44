# Brain Games

Welcome to Brain Games! This project contains several fun command-line games like brain-calc, brain-even, brain-gcd, brain-prime, and brain-progression. This collection of games serves as a fun and interactive way to practice and reinforce fundamental mathematical concepts! Player must give correct answers to 3 questions in the row to win each game, good luck! :D

Brain-calc is a simple math quiz, it is structured to challenge the user with a series of randomly generated math problems.

Brain-even challenges the user to correctly identify whether a randomly generated number is even or odd, responding with "yes" for even numbers and "no" for odd ones.
